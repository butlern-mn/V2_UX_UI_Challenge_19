                    <h1>Overview:</h1>
                    <p>Responsive Website Redesign of Non-Profit WRAP.</p>
                    <h1>Problem:</h1>
                    <p>Persons experiencing domestic violence feel overwhelmed and intimidated when trying to leave an abusive relationship. They need to be able to easily access local resources that help them take the first step in leaving. This can be even more challenging in rural areas with less resources available.</p>
                    <h1>Solution:</h1>
                    <p>A human centered approach using the design process - empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test - to provide a more intuitive and efficient solution for users of the WRAP website.</p>
                    <h1>Role:</h1>
                    <p>UX/UI Designer on a team of three.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="sectionTwo">
                <div class="casestudyDesc">
                    <p>This project was focused on redesigning a non-profit website. After reviewing multiple websites serving people experiencing domestic violence, the team chose WRAP - WoMenâ€™s Rural Advocacy Programs - as a site that could benefit from a human-centered redesign to provide a more efficient experience to those in need of services. Often, individuals in potentially dangerous situations, may have limited time to be able to look for the resources they are seeking. Making the services provided by WRAP easier and quicker to find and digest, could potentially protect someone from harm. </p>
                    <h1>Heuristics Evaluation:</h1>
                    <p>The team began by performing a heuristic evaluation of the WRAP website - both the desktop and mobile versions.  The Homepage and the Resources pages were the focus of this redesign project. </p>
                    <p>Key Findings Homepage:</p>
                    <ul class="listfont">
                        <li>Information in hero image is difficult to read</li>
                        <li>Global navigation is small</li>
                        <li>Poor layout/use of space - information is crammed together</li>
                        <li>Footer is excessively large and difficult to read</li>

                    <h1>Proto-Persona:</h1>
                    <p>A proto-persona was developed to allow the team to start to better understand who may come to the WRAP site looking for help and build empathy for them. </p>
                    <h1>User Research:</h1>
                    <p>A usability testing plan was developed and utilized by the team to interview 6 individuals that resembled the proto-persona. </p>
                    <p>On both the desktop and mobile website, participants were asked to:</p>
                    <ul class="listfont">
                        <li>Find the 24-hour crisis hotline number</li>

                        <li>Locate the Marshall WRAP office contact info in order to make an appt\ointment</li>
                        <li>Provide general feedback about the website and its usability</li>

                    <h1>Analysis:</h1>
                    <p>Usability testing yielded valuable results including:</p>
                    <ul class="listfont">
                        <li>100% of participants thought the hero image scrolled too fast and had difficulty reading the information on it</li>

                        <li>40% disliked the use of the color scheme for the site.  60% liked them, but suggested more moderate usage of them.</li>
                        <li>100% of participants suggested making the Crisis Hotline number bigger and more visible</li>
                        <li>100% of participants noted the resource page was hard to use due to lack of categorization</li>

                    <p>An 'I Like, I Wish, What If' exercise was completed to generate ideas. to support redesign options to assist Amelia.

                        <p>While working through the design process, style and brand for the website was discussed. Due to the nature of the services WRAP provides, it was determined that the esthetics of the site needed to be affirming, welcoming, inclusive, discreet, and accessible. It was determined better use of imagery to provide a sense of hope over anguish would be valuable as well as a redesign of the logo for more inclusivity. Considering usability testing feedback, and that purple is the representative color of domestic violence awareness, it was determined the branding colors would be kept, but the use would be more subtle and include gradients.</p>
